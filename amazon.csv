A Thousand Splendid Suns,Khaled Hosseini,4763,$10.10,432 pages,"Riverhead Books; Reprint edition (November 25, 2008)",English,159448385X,978-0739489505,5.1 x 0.9 x 8 inches,9.6 ounces,4.7 out of 5 stars,"#1,062 in Books","To be honest, I didn't think I would finish this book. I got through perhaps the first 50 pages and thought, there is no way I can finish this. I got through the first 100 pages and thought, I definitely will have to stop reading this. But, as you can see, I did finish it, and feel compelled to rate it 5 stars. This is *not* light reading. It is extremely heart-wrenching from start to finish. (I would also say that, if you are a survivor of domestic violence, be prepared for very descriptive passages of beatings, rape, strangulation, isolation, and other horrific abuse.) From the horrors of abuse to the horrors of war, this book does not leave any dark part of the human heart unexplored. And that is why it is so difficult to read. At the same time, it was not a book I could give up on. The character dynamics in the book are so complex that, after a while, they truly seemed like real people. The enduring power of Mariam's spirit is, all at once, beautiful, inspiring, and heartbreaking. And, even in a time of war, love and friendship ultimately survive. This story also gives some insight to Western readers about what Afghanistan was like, pre-9/11. I highly recommend this book and will be reading more by this author.","Propelled by the same superb instinct for storytelling that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once an incredible chronicle of thirty years of Afghan history and a deeply moving story of family, friendship, faith, and the salvation to be found in love. After 103 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list and with four million copies of The Kite Runner shipped, Khaled Hosseini returns with a beautiful, riveting, and haunting novel that confirms his place as one of the most important literary writers today. Born a generation apart and with very different ideas about love and family, Mariam and Laila are two women brought jarringly together by war, by loss and by fate. As they endure the ever escalating dangers around them-in their home as well as in the streets of Kabul-they come to form a bond that makes them both sisters and mother-daughter to each other, and that will ultimately alter the course not just of their own lives but of the next generation. With heart-wrenching power and suspense, Hosseini shows how a woman's love for her family can move her to shocking and heroic acts of self-sacrifice, and that in the end it is love, or even the memory of love, that is often the key to survival.A stunning accomplishment, A Thousand Splendid Suns is a haunting, heartbreaking, compelling story of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love."

I am, so far, a third of the way through at most, and it has been a lifeline in the areas where it struck me most close to home, where I dog-eared a page and went ""that's me, that's me and no one has put this into words before but me!"" and a thousand insights into other people's lives and the demands of allyship and advocacy for the people around me. A must-read, in my opinion, for any future therapists, educators, etc who intend to work with autistic clients, because I think it is CRUCIAL that we remember autistic people of color and we hear each other's voices. Who the book is FOR, though, is autistic people ourselves and particularly autistic people of color, and it is beautiful, broad, and guarantees, no matter who you are, a look into the life of someone far in a different position on the spectrum and in the world from you.

Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones,James Clear,927,$13.04,,"Avery (October 16, 2018)",English,0735211299,978-0735211292,6.3 x 1 x 9.3 inches,1.2 pounds,4.9 out of 5 stars,#65 in Books,"I've read a lot of books on changing behavior and building habits and James Clear's  Atomic Habits is my new favorite. This book is different from others in the way it covers an enormous amount of ground in the larger area of self-improvement while seamlessly tying all these ideas back into the central theme of habits. One of the core concepts in Atomic Habits is to focus on the small improvement. The impact a 1% improvement per day can make may appear negligible at first, but Clear makes a compelling argument that in the case of habits, thinking small produces the biggest results over time. ""Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement,"" explains Clear. Over the months and years, the accumulated effect of small habitual daily behaviors is staggering. Early in the book we are also warned that this compounding works both ways, so we'd better make sure we're making it work in the positive direction, not for the negative. This is a concept I was introduced to years ago under a different name - Kaizen - the Japanese term for continuous incremental improvement. What's different and new in this book is how the concept is applied specifically to building habits. I found the information introduced in chapter two about behavior change at the identity level to be spot-on. You're also given a simple two-step process for changing your identity and this one idea alone is incredibly powerful. In chapter three, we are introduced to the habit loop - cue, craving, response, reward - and we learn how to build good habits in 4 simple steps and break bad habits in 4 simple steps. One of those steps to habit formation, which goes hand in hand with the 1% concept, is how to make it not only small, but easy. In the chapters that follow, this is exactly what you find out. Other ideas of great value that stood out included, habit stacking (the best way to form a new habit), habit tracking, habit shaping and how to design your environment - physical and social - for habit building success. You learn the truth about self-control, how to stop procrastinating and how to use implementation intentions, temptation bundling and motivational rituals. The book is simply packed with actionable ideas, tactics and strategies. Virtually every idea in the book is useful and resonated with me. While I may not agree that we should ""forget about goals,"" I agree with one of Clear's core principles in the book - that we must develop systems for change. If we only focus on goals and don't develop systems and a focus on the process, we risk falling into a number of goal-related traps which ultimately lead to stagnation. With the right systems, we're rewarded with continuous improvement on a lifelong journey of success. Another difference between Atomic Habits and other books in this genre is that while it's based on science it doesn't bog you down with unnecessary details of the research. Clear's book is intensely practical, giving you a huge toolkit of organized and named strategies you can apply immediately to create and strengthen positive habits and stop the negative ones. The book is conversational, and includes many interesting stories, making it easy to read - and hard to put down (I read it cover to cover in one day). It's possible this might become your most highlighted personal improvement book because every page is so chocked full of memorable and quotable gems of advice.","The instant New York Times bestsellerTiny Changes, Remarkable ResultsNo matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving--every day. James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.Learn how to:  *  make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);  *  overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;  *  design your environment to make success easier;  *  get back on track when you fall off course;...and much more.Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal."
Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup,John Carreyrou,2398,$16.77,,"Knopf; 1 edition (May 21, 2018)",English,152473165X,978-1524731656,6.3 x 1.3 x 9.6 inches,1.5 pounds,4.8 out of 5 stars,#193 in Books,"This is an impeccably researched and referenced account of the Theranos saga. As a long-time observer and sometime competitor of Theranos I watched this tale unfold whilst working at a couple of established IVD companies. Everyone I knew who had ever developed an assay or instrument knew this was smoke and mirrors, impossibly too good to be true. What I never suspected was just how personally dishonest EH had been, and for how long the complex deception was maintained. Whilst I've met a few egregious individuals working for big companies, there are enough checks and balances (QA/RA, Med/Sci Affairs, CLSs and other professionals etc) in place to stop harmful devices getting out the door. The subject matter - developing devices and assays - is a complex dry topic, difficult to write engagingly about. But JC does a workmanlike job and I read this in one go after its midnight Kindle release. My only nit to pick is the poor editing: there are so many uses of '....named....' as in 'an engineer named John Smith' or 'a restaurant named Joe's Bar' that it got irritating. Find/replace 'named' with a comma would have worked fine in most cases. The text was also repetitive - eg '...an award named after Channing...' gets at least 2 mentions. But not enough to lose a star. Kudos to the good people at Theranos who had the courage to get the story out and for JCs persistence into a headwind of legalistic intimidation. I've heard Theranos is now a case-study for MBA students: this book should be required reading for anyone thinking about 'disrupting' the medical devices industry. There are lives at stake.","NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER •  NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY: NPR, The New York Times Book Review, Time, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post • The McKinsey Business Book of the Year   The full inside story of the breathtaking rise and shocking collapse of Theranos, the one-time multibillion-dollar biotech startup founded by Elizabeth Holmes—now the subject of the HBO documentary The Inventor—by the prize-winning journalist who first broke the story and pursued it to the end. “The story is even crazier than I expected, and I found myself unable to put it down once I started. This book has everything: elaborate scams, corporate intrigue, magazine cover stories, ruined family relationships, and the demise of a company once valued at nearly $10 billion.” —Bill Gates In 2014, Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was widely seen as the female Steve Jobs: a brilliant Stanford dropout whose startup “unicorn” promised to revolutionize the medical industry with a machine that would make blood testing significantly faster and easier. Backed by investors such as Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, Theranos sold shares in a fundraising round that valued the company at more than $9 billion, putting Holmes’s worth at an estimated $4.7 billion. There was just one problem: The technology didn’t work. A riveting story of the biggest corporate fraud since Enron, a tale of ambition and hubris set amid the bold promises of Silicon Valley."
Becoming,Michelle Obama,12673,$19.50,,"Crown Publishing Group; 1st edition (November 13, 2018)",English,1524763136,978-1524763138,6.4 x 1.2 x 9.5 inches,1.8 pounds,4.9 out of 5 stars,#10 in Books,"I eagerly anticipated this book for two reasons that don’t fit well together.  First, although I do not know the Obamas, I have several friends who are close personal friends of both Michelle and Barack (this results from my attending law school while Barack was teaching, and living in Chicago for some years thereafter).  Second, I am not particularly a fan of their politics, although I obviously have nothing against them personally.  Thus, I think I can offer an objective view of this book—and I found it both moving and worthwhile. What comes across most in this book is Michelle Obama’s lack of self-pity combined with clarity of vision.  I suspect this was a difficult book to write—she knew that whatever she wrote, somebody, and maybe a lot of people, would criticize her for it.  She therefore focuses quite a bit on what might be called practical insight and empowerment, rather than on settling political scores.  That’s probably a wise choice—after all, her husband’s terms as President showed that very few people were interested in political settlements or compromise. The first third of the book covers her childhood (“Becoming Me”).  Contrary to the stereotype of Democrats as the party of the elite, Obama’s childhood, at least, was working class.  She grew up in the lower middle class South Shore neighborhood of Chicago; her father was a boiler operator.  Obama grew up in a stable household where her parents made their high expectations clear, though family life had its challenges, especially her father’s falling ill with multiple sclerosis.  Still, she managed to go to Princeton, then Harvard Law, and then to work at the ultra-prestigious Chicago law firm of Sidley & Austin, where she met Barack (and where my wife worked, a few years after that time).  I started law school in 1991, when Barack had just returned to Chicago from Harvard; he was much talked about even before he began teaching at the University of Chicago, because a high-powered Harvard graduate did not often choose to return to community organizing, rather than working for a white-shoe firm like Sidley.  In contrast, Michelle Obama makes clear in this book she’s the organized, path-following one, who shows up on time, unlike her husband, which is probably why law firm life suited her better. These initial years with Barack form the second third of the book (“Becoming Us”); one can tell that Obama struggled with her husband’s political ambition, because being a political spouse always imposes tremendous costs on the one not running for office (and she is explicit she has no interest in herself running for office).  In fact, she talks at some length about the couples’ counseling they had to go through as a result, though it seems to have worked out for them!  All of this is quite interesting, and much more readable than the massive biography of Barack that David Garrow wrote two years ago, “Rising Star,” which defeated my repeated attempts to read it, by having far too much irrelevant detail.  Michelle Obama does not make that mistake here, for which the reader, or at least this reader, is grateful. Obama closes the last third of the book with what was probably the hardest part to write, “Becoming More.”  She talks about the stress, but also the opportunity to offer her vision, that being in the spotlight meant, and she criticizes Barack’s successor in office in no uncertain, but in measured, terms.  At the end, she remains optimistic, but one gets a little of the feeling that she isn’t certain her optimism is warranted. I have a lot of sympathy for Michelle Obama.  Every person in power, whether that power is direct or indirect, is always ultimately frustrated, but it must gall her to see the contrast between her husband and Donald Trump.  I think that she picked the right path of not making that the focus of the book, though.  She’s a grounded pragmatist at heart, or at least so it seems from this book.  And we could all use a lot more grounded pragmatism, so her contribution to public discourse with this book is (unlike many political autobiographies) both illuminating and valuable.","An intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • OPRAH’S BOOK CLUB PICK • NAACP IMAGE AWARD WINNER In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.    In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same."
Blindness (Harvest Book),Jose Saramago,700,$9.27,352 pages,"Harvest Books; First edition (October 4, 1999)",English,0156007754,978-0156007757,5.3 x 0.9 x 8 inches,7.2 ounces,3.7 out of 5 stars,"#25,257 in Books","People have argued about human nature since people learned to argue. I used to think that, being social creatures, we have a tendency to be kind to one another, to get along. My friends who stayed in New Orleans while the rest of us evacuated for Hurricane Katrina confirmed that: they told stories about working with neighbors to share resources, watching out for one another. But they lived in areas of the city that didn't flood. In other parts, people didn't always have the luxury of kindness, and things spiraled into chaos and fear. When I read a book like Blindness, I'm reminded of those and other events in my own life that have caused me to qualify my beliefs. I still think humanity has a near-limitless capacity for altruism, but mostly when we're comfortable. When the stakes are high, compassion is the first thing to go. Saramago isn't the first author to write about societal collapse, either real or fictional, but he's among the best to do so. That's because he offers not just realistic details of how things go from bad to worse to worst, but also because he does so with a unique writing style that's just as chaotic as the situations he describes. Characters aren't given names, just descriptors. Dialogue isn't punctuated with quotation marks and paragraphs, it runs together, sometimes for pages at a time. It's exactly the kind of sensory overload that someone who's just lost one of her five senses would experience: an onslaught of information with a diminished capacity to process it. As a reader, though, I found I quickly adapted to his writing style. The plot moves briskly and kept me engrossed. And the images that Saramago paints for those of us who can see are breathtaking. Long after I've forgotten the plot, that's what I'll remember about the novel. I could quibble with the ending, I could complain that Saramago pulled a punch (kind of like McCarthy does at the end of The Road). Then again, the entire book is an extended metaphor, so I'm not sure it could've concluded in any other way.","A stunningly powerful novel of man's will to survive against all odds, by the winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Literature. “This is a shattering work by a literary master.”—The Boston GlobeA New York Times Notable Book of the Year A Los Angeles Times Best Book of the Year  A city is hit by an epidemic of ""white blindness"" which spares no one. Authorities confine the blind to an empty mental hospital, but there the criminal element holds everyone captive, stealing food rations and raping women. There is one eyewitness to this nightmare who guides seven strangers—among them a boy with no mother, a girl with dark glasses, a dog of tears—through the barren streets, and the procession becomes as uncanny as the surroundings are harrowing. A magnificent parable of loss and disorientation and a vivid evocation of the horrors of the twentieth century, Blindness has swept the reading public with its powerful portrayal of man's worst appetites and weaknesses—and man's ultimately exhilarating spirit."

CIRCE,Madeline Miller,1491,$17.41,,"Little, Brown and Company; 1st Edition edition (April 10, 2018)",English,0316556343,978-0316556347,6.4 x 1.6 x 9.6 inches,1.4 pounds,4.6 out of 5 stars,#546 in Books,"Brief summary, no spoilers. I know it may be odd to talk about “spoilers” when this is the story of a mythological character, but there are reasons for that and I will explain in the review. This book is told from the point of view of Circe, daughter of the sun Titan Helios. Her mother was  Perse, a sea nymph who was the  granddaughter of the Titan Oceanos. We mainly know of Circe from the Odyssey and her interactions with Odysseus.  She was known as a sorceress who lived on an island and turned men into pigs. We  know from the Odyssey that Circe was often seen working at a huge loom surrounded by dangerous animals such as wolves and lions, yet they were all under her control.  We also know from the Odyssey that Odysseus - by virtue of his wiles - not only avoids Circe’s sorcery but beds her as well. When he leaves she gives him advice on how to survive the perils on his seaward journey home to his homeland of Ithaca, such as Scylla and Charybdis,  so he can reunite with his beloved wife Penelope and son Telemachus. So why did I like this book so much? Well, stand back, because I’m about to gush. I am a big fan of Greek mythology, and I was a big fan of this author’s previous book, The Song of Achilles. Yet this one was even better. Circe was not a major figure in the Odyssey; in fact when I first opened the book I realized I got her mixed up with Calypso. But I won’t make that mistake anymore. This minor character has now become my favorite character of all thanks to this author’s brilliant work. Because this book is told from Circe’s point of view, we get to intimately know her - not just her history and story but her thoughts as well. The reason this is so important is because we come to empathize with Circe. We tend to think of the Greek Gods as so fickle and often cruel - and indeed they are often depicted that way - yet with Circe, we meet a goddess who is so human and so very, very likable. The reason I made the “no spoilers” comment at the start, is because Circe’s experiences include her meeting and interacting with various other figures from Greek myth, and it’s a big part of the enjoyment of this novel to experience it the way the author intended, without knowing what is going to happen next. I took a few days to read this book but that was not because it was a slow read. Just the opposite; I was so happy while reading it that I would stop myself after each chapter just to pace myself so it wouldn’t end too soon. I highly (obviously) recommend this to any fans of Greek mythology and for sure to anyone who enjoyed The Song of Achilles. But you don’t have to know much about the Odyssey or Greek mythology to love this book. Although this novel is about a god, it’s really a story about what it means to be human.","""A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess's story,"" this #1 New York Times bestseller is ""both epic and intimate in its scope, recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right"" (Alexandra Alter, The New York Times).In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world.#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER--NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR, The Washington Post, People, Time, Amazon,Entertainment Weekly, Bustle, Newsweek, the A.V.

It presents an analytical approach to the class struggle (historical and present) and the problems of capitalism, rather than a prediction of communism's potential future forms.The book contains Marx and Engels' Marxist theories about the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, ""The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."" It also briefly features their ideas for how the capitalist society of the time would eventually be replaced by socialism, and then eventually communism.FEATURES Includes beautiful artworks and illustrations  A link of a FREE audio book to download at the end of the book Active Table of Contents for an easy navigation within the book Saves space and don t have to carry a hard copy around Offers an easy access and convenience to this classic literary masterpiece for a reasonable price Gives a lasting entertainment and values for readers of all ages"
